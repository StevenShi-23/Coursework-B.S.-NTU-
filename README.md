# Coursework-B.S.-NTU-

This is a repo of some of group and individual coursework I have been involved in my undergraduate as a Computer Science student in Nanyang Technological University and as an exchange student in New York University. 

Please feel free to download and refer to the files to gain an understanding of what you may be required to do for that course. Please be kindly reminded that the requirements of course may change over time, also, copy of whole / part of others article without citation is plagiarism.

Everyone involved in the collaborated work is credited at my best. Besides, I would like to thank the professors of NTU and NYU for their effort to make the courses possible. Please contact me or start a pull request if you found an issue. 

Thank you. Bon voyage!
